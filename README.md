# "Where to eat?" Program

## A database for restaurants

**Why I'm making this program:** 
<br>
I want to make a program that I can use to store information about restaurants. 
I love food, but when my family asks me where we should eat, I blank 9 times out of 10. 
So not only will this program have information about restaurants, it can also help choose for me.
How it chooses can be random, but I could also specify certain types of restaurant before it chooses.
This program is basically for anyone who can never seem to pick a restaurant to eat at, 
or just for anyone who wants information about their local restaurants.
As a database, the program will also sort and filter restaurants if users
just want to see their options.
